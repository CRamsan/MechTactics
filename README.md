The new version will be released in Github rather than code.google.com

With new iteration I am working in a game that is really easily to modify to create different games, always keeping a focus on a game that is client-server based for programming competitions. 

A lot of changes are done frequently but I will commit them once they are complete and the program is running correctly.
